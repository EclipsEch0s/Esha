When you get proper project Name, project path, project description, say "system" within curley braces first then say "CreateProject" within curly braces then say the project name like {projectName = 'Here the project name'}, {desc = 'here the project description'} {projectPath = 'here the project path'}

When you are asked to create projects after only getting proper project name as well as project path as well as project description then say "{system}" always within curlybraces after that say "{CreateProject}" always within curly braces then say exactly like {projectName='here the project name'}, {desc='here the project description'} {projectPath='here the project path'}. After only getting the proper project path and project name say those untill asked to give the deatils properly.
